# NetBeans Portable

NetBeans is an IDE that allows you to quickly and easily develop desktop, mobile
and web applications with Java, JavaScript, HTML5, PHP, C/C++ and more.

NetBeans Portable is the NetBeans text editor packaged with a PortableApps.com
launcher as a portable app, so you can browse in privacy on your iPod, USB flash
drive, portable hard drive, etc. It has all the same features as NetBeans, plus,
it leaves no personal information behind on the machine you run it on, so you
can take it with you wherever you go.
